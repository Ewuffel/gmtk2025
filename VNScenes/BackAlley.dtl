	I don't know what you told him, but I keep my dealings with him very confidential.
	I can't be associating with anyone who talks to him.

		V\: Wait, what? Let's see here...
		<Empty Text Event>
		Ambitious Amber. Beautiful color. You're in luck, I just ran out of what I had.
		Well, you know the deal. What do you wanna know?
		J\: My brother's dead.
		V\: So Jeremiah finally bit it, eh?
		Figured it'd happen sooner or later. Always-
		J\: What do you know about it?
		V\: Jeez, have some patience why don't ya?
		I may not know anything about it, but the police probably do.
		J\: They ruled it a suicide.
		V\: Knowing them, they don't actually believe that.
		We've got a word for people like them back on Mars.
		...
		Anyway, if you wanna see what they've got, they leave the key to their back office in the bushes they got outside their door.
		Anyway, thanks for the paint, kid. Be seein' ya.
	- J: Sorry to bother you
		<Empty Text Event>
		V\: You should be. Now leave me alone, your presence is sapping my talent.
	- J: Did you kill my brother?
		V\: So Jeremiah finally bit it, eh?
		Figured it'd happen sooner or later. Always stickin' his nose where it didn't belong.
		But no, I didn't kill him. I assume it happened last night, yeah?
		We got back this morning from a week long trip to Rigel 7.
		- J: I don't believe you.
			V\: Well that's your choice. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a masterpiece to finish.
		- J: Alright, sounds plausible.
			V\: Cool. Now leave me alone.
		- J: What about this business card I found in his Jacket? | [if {inventory.bizcard}]
			V\: That's one of ours alright. Couldn't tell ya how he got it.
			Must have been a sloppy job if the corpse was still there.
			If I'd done it, you'd never have seen him again.
			I'll tell you though, if I had to point fingers it would be at that geezer who lives next to you.
			J\: You mean my granny?
			V\: Yeah, that one. Higher body count than me. Plus, I thought I saw something weird under the rug there once.
			Now listen, I don't have any more time to spare. I'm gonna be selling this thing in the Centauri system soon and my shuttle leaves at 12.
			So beat it.
